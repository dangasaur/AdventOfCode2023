# Ben's Mediocre Attempt at Advent of Code 2023

## Stack
I'm trying to do everything in Rust this year. My ambition is as follows:

1. (WEAK) - Get day-by-day solutions in their own folders/projects/main.rs files
2. (GOOD) - Get day-by-day solutions working via CLI ie. aoc.exe --day 2.1 input_day2.txt
3. (GREAT) - UI that allows user to select day, phase, and input file then outputs solution AND explanation of my logic. I'd use HTMX and it would be sweet. Chances of this happening are extremely slim for the first couple weeks :(

## Tools
I'm using...
- JetBrains RustRover
- WSL2
- Rust 1.75-nightly

## How to Run
**<TBD>**
